// TestDetermineActionAndResource_APIKey pins F176 fix: the audit middleware
// must classify both the tenant-scoped /apikeys routes and the project-
// scoped /projects/:id/apikeys routes as apikey resources, not as project
// resources or as the default "unknown" bucket.
//
// Prior to the fix the branch at audit.go:140 matched "/api-keys" (with a
// hyphen) which never matched any real route. /projects/:id/apikeys was
// swallowed by the /projects branch (logged as project.created), and the
// tenant-level POST /apikeys fell into the default resource.created /
// unknown bucket. The apikey.created / apikey.deleted actions declared in
// model/audit.go and registered in service/audit.go were dead code.
